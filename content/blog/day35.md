some small stuff here and there

also tried to use FinalBuild/data folder and `.fst` files

(`.fst` files are packages (internal file system))

but seems that some of them are compressed and my zlib decompress returned `Z_BAD_DATA` error on them :-/

probably have to run modified windows version and decompress+dump all files :-) because in `"source"` `/data` folder not all of them are present (at least that is what I think)

added draw indexed triangles function, so now I see models! yay!
