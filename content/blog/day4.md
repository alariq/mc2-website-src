unicode / mbs / char mess........

still mess, but at leas it compiles :-) not links though ))

started to create duplicates for windows headers: windows.h / winnt.h / winuser.h / windef.h / winnls.h etc...

another folder called mclib is compiling (without subfolders though)

using `NULL` instead of `'\0'`, e.g. `char* aa; aa[0] = NULL`
