It has finally happened!
today I've seen first ran of mc2 on Linux! I can see intro and main menu and even exit game :-)

pretty much all other options just crash the game ))

still, a lot of work has been done and much is left to do.

I like clang compiler for its messages, already fixed several potential code issues (which, by the way, were in a shipped product!!!)

but now Viewer application crahses :-) will have to look into it, but tomorrow... or I mean today, but later when night will pass :-)

bye!
