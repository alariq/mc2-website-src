continue with various fixes.

one that was quite scary is memery block filling with NANs. when first memory was cast to `long*` but number of iterations was divided only by 4, ..who cares about 64bit `long` in 2001

finally I can play a game now! though mech would not move where I tell them, only start moving and then stop again.
It is interesting, that they move if they need to come closer to shoot (when I aim cursor at the target and click)
