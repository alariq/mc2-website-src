submitted resolution change code

fixed mouse movement (yeah, I noticed that mouse which was laying all this time nearby and actully plugged it in to see that it works poorly :-), so I fixed it, I hope :-))

also added one more fix to "broken lights" problem

some changes to edit box (actually uncommented most of temporarily `#ifdef`ed code)
