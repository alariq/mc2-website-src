fixed a problem with texture that had `id = 0` not being applied :-)
it was a font texture (used at least for in-game text), so some text was not visible due to this reason

Image of the day: [{{< figure src="/images/devblog/day53_2016-12-01-145456_1920x1080_scrot.png" alt="click to expand">}}](/images/devblog/day53_2016-12-01-145456_1920x1080_scrot.png)
