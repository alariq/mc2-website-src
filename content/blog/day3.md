Fixed some more bugs

started to create window-like headers, and implement windows functions(mostly string related) so less work will be needed to do

MemoryPtr defined in 8 places :(

memory heaps... a lot of asm... but there is an option in the code to use GameOS memeory heap, of course that one has no implementation, but I can do something to it, so switch to GameOS heap and throw away all scary ASM code

compression - guess what - ASM! replace by zlib
