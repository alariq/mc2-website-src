implemented simple zlib compression/decompression

textures are still not handled correctly, well nothing is implemented, but cursor initialization code at least does not crash :-)

still have to implement at least stubs for texture lock, and `create_texture` functions


`File::readLong` is not what it should do, because long at tht time was 4 bytes! 

how many of those still left.... :-/
